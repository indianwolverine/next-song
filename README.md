# next-song
Have you ever been at a party and questioned the musical tastes of the secret cabal in charge of the playlist?

Or maybe you've been relaxing at your favorite coffee shop, listening to smooth jazz, when suddenly Alt-J interrupts Coltrane?

Next=>Song is a project to develop an interactive, realtime playlist for any social occasion or public place, where people get to suggest songs and vote on the next one they want to here. 
Because, after all, shouldn't the people control (the atmosphere of) the party?
